Unit 11 Challenge

#Description:

Work on this project was implemented at the request of the client, whose user story stated the following: "AS A social media startup I WANT an API for my social network that uses a NoSQL database SO THAT my website can handle large amounts of unstructured data."

The Challenge for this project was to build an API for a social network web application where users can share their thoughts, react to friends’ thoughts, and create a friend list. To do this, the following will be used for successful completion: Express.js for routing, a MongoDB database, the Mongoose ODM for the open-source NoSQL database management system, and Insomnia to test the functionality of the finished product. In addition to using the Express.js and Mongoose packages, an optional inclusion was to use a JavaScript date library of my choosing, or the native JavaScript `Date' object, to format timestamps; I elected not to utilize this option for this project.

##Acceptance Criteria:

GIVEN a social network API
WHEN I enter the command to invoke the application
THEN my server is started and the Mongoose models are synced to the MongoDB database
WHEN I open API GET routes in Insomnia for users and thoughts
THEN the data for each of these routes is displayed in a formatted JSON
WHEN I test API POST, PUT, and DELETE routes in Insomnia
THEN I am able to successfully create, update, and delete users and thoughts in my database
WHEN I test API POST and DELETE routes in Insomnia
THEN I am able to successfully create and delete reactions to thoughts and add and remove friends to a user’s friend list
